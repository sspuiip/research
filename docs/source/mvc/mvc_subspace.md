# Multi-View Subspace Clustering



## Multi-View data

Multi-view data set are generated by multiple distinct feature sets.

For example, an image can be represented by the color, shapes, texture and so on. a document is described by several different languages.

## Subspace clustering

Subspace learning assumes that the single source data are drawn from multiple low-dimensional subspaces.

- typical methods:
    - iteration based methods
    - factorization based methods
    - statistical approaches
    - spectral clustering based approaches


### Standard subspace clustering

Given $n$ data points $X=\{\mathbf{x}_1,\cdots,\mathbf{x}_n\}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times n}$, the **self-expression property** of the data set are used to represent itself as,

$$
X=XZ+E
$$

where $Z=\{\mathbf{z}_1,\cdots,\mathbf{z}_n\}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is the subspace representation matrix, and each $\mathbf{z}_i$ stands for the data point $\mathbf{x}_i$ in the subspace. $E\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times n}$ is the error matrix.

We know that each data point $\mathbf{x}_j$ can be mapped to a new space through a dictionary  $A=[\mathbf{b}_1,\cdots,\mathbf{b}_k]$, i.e., $\mathbf{x}_j=\sum_{i=1}w_{ji}\mathbf{b}_i$. Self-expression  is just replacing the dictionary with data matrix itself.


$$
\mathbf{x}_j=\sum_{i=1}^k W_{ji}\mathbf{b}_i, \quad i.e., \begin{bmatrix}x_{j1}\\x_{j2}\\\vdots\\ x_{jd} \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}| &|&\cdots &|\\ \mathbf{b}_1 &\mathbf{b}_2&\cdots &\mathbf{b}_k\\| &|&\cdots &|\\\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}w_{j1}\\w_{j2}\\\vdots\\ w_{jk} \end{bmatrix}
$$

so we have the following equation,

$$
\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{BW}
$$
